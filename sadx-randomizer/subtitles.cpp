Report cargo status of captured hedgehog aboard, over.","That's a ten-four. Cargo secured on board and - What?!?","Didn't copy that, over!","The hedgehog is gone! He's taken out everyone aboard and...what in the world?!?","Freeze! What do you think you're doing?! Get that hedgehog!!","What's wrong?!? Come in, over!!","Talk about low-budget flights! No food or movies? I'm outta here!","I like running better.","Yeah!!","This game of tag is boring; I'm outta here!","Hmm, finally decided to show up, eh? Okay, bring it on!","Those robots are a total pain in the...","What?!?","It all starts with this.","A jewel containing the ultimate power.","That's the... Chaos Emerald!","$#@!","Now I know what's going on.","The military has mistaken me for the likes of you!","So, where do you think you're going with that Emerald?","Say something! You fake hedgehog!","Chaos Control!","Wow, he's fast!","BOW TO ME","Hey, it's not his speed.","He must be using the Chaos Emerald to warp!","My name is Shadow. I'm the world's Ultimate Life Form. There's no time for games; farewell!","Kuu! ...Shadow... what is he?","Don't move; stay where you are. Keep your hands up in the air!","Huh?","Not again...","Shoot!","Just let it go! You just don't know when to give up, do you?","$#@!","What are you talking about? That Emerald's mine. You got that? The Master Emerald contains special powers that neutralize the energy of the Chaos Emeralds; that makes it very powerful.","What the?!?","$#@!","Wha -- thief!!","Look who's calling who a thief.","I came here following the signal from the emerald. If I'm not mistaken, this is the Master Emerald, is it not?","It's you... Doctor Eggman.","So that's Doctor Eggman.","Well, I guess I can use it for something. I'll just take it with me. Farewell, Knucklehead.","Not if I can help it!","AHHHH!","What was that all about?! And look what you did to my Emerald!","I did that to prevent it from being stolen, you idiot! If it's in pieces, I can restore it. And by the way, that's not your Emerald.","Hmm... doesn't matter. I'll look into it once I get back to the base.","I despise anyone who takes jewels from me. All the world's gems are mine to keep!","Yeah, well we'll see about that, bat girl!","What?","There's no mistake about it; this must be the island. It's a secret military base that is reinforced, and super strong. It's called Prison Island.","I heard the news about it on satellite TV. I still can't believe that Sonic would destroy the military buildings, or rob the bank. Wait for me, okay Sonic? I'm on my way.","What?!?","Hey, look, it's Amy! And Eggman too. What's Amy doing here?","Doesn't matter. I have to help Amy, because she's in danger. Tornado Transformation!","This time I'll let you go. But the next time we meet, you won't be so lucky.","Wow Tails, you did it! But what are you doing here on this island?","I'm the one who should be asking that question. Don't you know it's dangerous here?","I know, but I'm here to save my hero, Sonic!","Again?","Hurry! I know Eggman's up to no good again!","Okay. You stay here, I'll be right back.","Don't leave without me! I wanna help Sonic too!","Huh? Amy?","Shh! Keep your voice down! Have no fear...Amy Rose is here!","How'd you get here?","Well, if you gotta know, I caught a ride with Tails.","Are you sure you don't need my help? It looks like you could use it.","The reason I'm in here is because of that fake hedgehog!","You mean... that black hedgehog?","Did you see it? Where is it now?","If I tell ya, will you marry me?","No way!","I thought I had you this time.","That black hedgehog came here with Dr. Eggman.","So Eggman's behind this, huh?","What's all that writing on the walls anyway? Did you write that?","Wait for me, Sonic! He's such a brat sometimes.","Phew, so far so good.","Hey, that's-","That blue hedgehog again, of all places!","I found you, faker!","Faker? I think you're the fake hedgehog around here. You're comparing yourself to me? Hah! You're not even good enough to be my fake.","I'll make you eat those words!","Shadow! What are you doing?! Hurry and get back here right now before the island blows up with you on it!","Blows up?!","I gotta get outta here, and find Amy and Tails... right away!","This place sure feels haunted... There's no time to lose. I have to hurry and find the Master Emerald.","Hahahah! Citizens of Earth, lend me your ears and listen to me very carefully. My name is Dr. Eggman, the world's greatest scientist! And soon to be the world's greatest ruler!","From this moment forward, you are all citizens of the great Eggman Empire! (Unused)","Now, witness the beginning of the greatest empire of all time! Hahaha!","Mwhahahahahaha! Ahahahahahaha!","Look! Half of the Moon is gone?!","Eggman! Oh, that creep never gives up!","But how did he manage to harness all that energy?","It's got to be the Chaos Emeralds... Yeah, that's why they were looking for 'em!","Tails?!","$#@!","The Chaos Emeralds are like magnets; they have the power to attract each other. I can use that to find where Eggman is!","$#@!","The three of you; freeze! Put your hands up in the air and get on the ground!","Tails, I'll take care of the police, while you try and find a way outta here. Find Eggman!","Got it!","\"The three of you?\" That means me, too! Hey wait!","$#@!","$#@!","$#@!","$#@!","$#@!","$#@!","$#@!","$#@!","Hmm... I didn't expect the inside of the mines to be like this. This is gonna be tougher than I thought!","Sheesh! There always seems to be a lot of police around when you don't need 'em. Tails, any news yet?","For some reason, I'm not getting a signal from the six remaining Chaos Emeralds. Maybe Eggman took the emeralds into outer space.","Okay! Let's meet up there!","There's a dead end up ahead. Spread out and find them!","Outer space?","Knuckles!","$#@!","Hey guys. Long time no see! I must have got lost in the mines. Looking for those Master Emerald pieces was tougher than I thought it would be. Where are we, anyway?","Hey, where are you going?!","Move aside, Knuckles!","I managed to find the transcrpits between Eggman and the President in the government computer. I'm following the President's limo right now.","Hey! Wait for me, Tails!","If we get into the limo, we can trace the call to find Eggman!","Mr. President, reports show that since the incident three hours ago, the country is in turmoil. Our financial communities are impacted and our satellite communications are down. An emergency meeting has been called. Mr. President, this is a national crisis.","Spare me the details. Exactly just what is it that you want... Dr. Eggman?","Hahaha! Well, let's just get down to business then, shall we, Mr. President? I won't bore you with all the details since I know you are a very busy man. Mr. President, my demands are quite simple: Surrender to the Eggman Empire and make no attempts to resist! Otherwise...","Otherwise?","Otherwise your country will cease to exist! You have 24 hours to give me your answer!","No way!","What the?","Sonic! You...!","What the heck is going on here?","Eggman Empire... Yeah right!","Oh no! What did you do?!","Don't worry, Mr. President. Everything's under control. Just leave it to us! Got it, Tails?","$#@!","I got it! He's transmitting from the Space Colony ARK!","Wait up, Sonic!","Okay! Let's move it!","Hey you, wait!","Mr. President, we're receiving an incoming signal from our agent.","*chuckle*","*grunt*","Inside that pyramid?","I saw Eggman go inside the pyramid, and more importantly, I saw that bat girl go inside with him as well. You saw them, too, right?","Well, yeah.","We should be able to get into outer space from there. I don't know what this space colony is all about, but I'll find and destroy that cannon, and then kick their imperial butts!","All right!","I'll go and find the entrance!","Looks like we're heading toward the center of the base.","That egghead sure loves mechanical things, doesn't he. I'll bet he has one or two spaceships lying around here somewhere.","The door is locked. We need a key to get in there!","No problem! We can find it, right Knuckles?","What? Why do I have to find the key?","We're counting on you, buddy, the world's greatest treasure hunter!","Huh? Who's there?","What the... a ghost?","What?! A ghost?!","*sigh* That was pretty rough!","We did it! Let's go, Amy!","You little thieves! Did you really think you could get out of here alive?","Come and get some, Eggman!","Sonic!","Just leave it to me!","This time, I'll take your lives as well as the Chaos Emerald! I call on you to destroy these pests! Come out, my servant!","Yeah!","Eh?!","Whoa!","Whoa!","Green light for launch. Primary engine ignition on. Beginning liftoff countdown. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6...","5, 4, 3, 2, 1...","Shuttle liftoff!","So this is the space colony where Eggman is hiding.","What the?!","Is everyone all right? We should be landing soon.","Oh no! The hatch doors are open!","Don't sweat it, Knuckles! The only thing in the cargo bay are those Master Emeralds... right?","What do you mean, \"don't sweat it!\"? Land the shuttle and let me out!","Knock it off, Knuckles! We're gonna crash this thing if you keep that up... OH NO! Don't touch that lever!","WHOOOOAAAAA","WAAAAAAAAAA","WHAAAAAAA","What's up with that knucklehead, anyway? Trying to take over the shuttle... I thought we were toast for sure!","Huh? Where did he go now?","Looks like he bailed.","This place looks deserted. Dusty too!","This place was shut down about 50 years ago because of a terrible accident.","$#@!","The first Bernoulli spherical space colony, called ARK.","When it was operational, it was the most advanced research center of its kind, but looking at it now...","Now it's an abandoned ARK, wouldn't you say?","There's not much time left before Eggman fires that weapon again. We've got to hurry! Let's find the cannon and destroy it!","Yeah!","Someone designed that weapon to be impenetrable from outside attacks. Its defense shields are super strong, so we have to find a way to destroy it from inside.","Isn't that a Chaos Emerald?","It looks like it, doesn't it? But in fact, it's a fake one I created after researching the real emerald. It has the same wavelength and properties, but it's less powerful than the real one.","It's designed to reverse the energy field inside the Chaos Emeralds and blow up. It looks so real, even a machine can't tell the difference.","I'll find the power supply and destroy it! Sonic, you find the control room, okay?","So the plan is, we'll switch the Chaos Emeralds when the machine has stopped, right?","I hate you! You guys always leave me behind and have all the fun!","Tails! I found the control room!","Got it! I'll destroy the power supply!","Okay, Sonic! Now put that emerald...","Ahem! Tails, tell Sonic to meet you back at the research facility. Now!","Sonic! Amy is...","I didn't get that, Tails. What happened to Amy? Tails!","Long time no see, treasure hunter! Did you find MY emeralds?","That's a good one! YOUR Emerald? Talking to you is a waste of time!","*breathing heavily*","*breathing heavily*","Stop fooling around and give me back my emeralds!","Stop fooling around and give me back my emeralds!","What are you babbling about? You call yourself a hunter? Attacking a lady? Shame on you!","What kind of lady goes around stealing gems, anyway?","Those belong to me... aaah!","Keep your hands to yourself! Don't touch me!","Is that how you say thanks to someone who just saved your life?","Saving my life. Don't think I owe you one! You just wanted to hold my hand, didn't you? That's why you saved me. You're such a creep!","This isn't a joke, you know. Think what you want, bat girl. I was saving the Master Emerald!","*sigh* No matter what you say, it sounds crazy!","Wha?","Fine. Then just take them. They stink like echidnas do!","If that's what you thought, you should have given me them in the first place!","Finally!","What?","I'm sorry... if I hurt you.","We should get going.","AAAAH","What in the world?","Let's take care of business first, shall we, Sonic? Hand over the Chaos Emerald, slowly, and then we'll talk about your girlfriend. That is, if you really care for her!","Handing over the fake emerald... I can kill two birds with one stone!","Put the emerald down right there and back off!","You've turned into a big-time villain, Doctor!","You thought you could trick me with that fake emerald, didn't you?","So... how did you know it wasn't the real one?","Tails!","Heh! Because you just told me, fox boy!","Now, for a little space ride!","The capsule clears the colony, BAM!","I'm counting on you, Tails! And Amy... take care of yourself.","Farewell, Sonic the Hedgehog!","It's not fair, Eggman!","Sonic!","\"It has the same wavelength and properties, but it's less powerful than the real one!\"","The same wavelength and properties...","But, can I do this?","Farewell, Sonic, my admirable adversary...","Soniiiic! *crying*","Now we have some unfinished business to take care of. If you give me the real emerald, I will release you both! You have my promise!","Sonic...","Huh?","Sonic has asked me for the first time to do something for him. I won't let him down! I won't give up!!","Whoa!","Hahahahaha","I feel some strange energy...","Hey, Sonic!","Whoa. I wasn't sure if I could pull that one off. Somehow I managed to use the Chaos Control.","Chaos Control?","Are you okay?","I'm worried about Tails and Amy. I hate to ask, but, could you help them?","This is our last chance... I got it! Before the cannon fires, I'll slam-dunk it in there!","You never cease to surprise me, blue hedgehog. I thought that capsule you were in exploded in space.","You know, what can I say? I die hard!","You actually saved me, you know.","It was a Chaos Emerald, wasn't it? But, there's no way you could have activated the Chaos Control using an emerald that's fake!","So, there's more to you than just looking like me. What are you, anyway?","What you see is what you get. Just a guy that loves adventure. I'm Sonic the Hedgehog!","$#@!","I see. But you know, I can't let you live. Your adventuring days are coming to an end!","Sonic. I did it...","Awesome job, Tails!","Sonic!","Look outside!","Eh?","Oooh!","Eggman steals the research from a military base located on an island to the south. The military's top secret weapon: Shadow, sealed in the Space Colony ARK. The seven Chaos Emeralds...","When all of the keys have been collected, world conquest will be at hand.

Wishes are eternal.","Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Security breach at Gate 3! Intruder has been located in the north quadrant and is moving in the direction of the underground base. All units prepare to engage! Emergency battle formations! Standard battle procedures initiated! Locate and stop the intruder from entering the security area. This is not a drill, repeat, this is not a drill!","Hahahahaha! That was all too easy!","Let's take a look at what my grandfather was working on... a top-secret military weapon! The military shut down the research because they feared it!","Oh-ho!","So this is the military's top secret weapon? It's a lot smaller than I expected.","Enter user data, uh-huh. Enter password.","Password is, MA-RI-A. Maria! Now all I have to do is to place the Chaos Emerald into this console.","What's that? Is that you, Sonic? Are you trying to spoil my plans again?!","Wait a minute. You're not Sonic! This is impossible!","My name is Shadow. Since you were so kind to release me, my master...","$#@!","I will grant you one wish.","$#@!","Now what?!","Behold the true power I possess!","$#@!","Destroying that guard robot was spectacular!","So, Shadow. You are the military's top secret weapon! But what did you mean when you said you will grant me a wish?","Bring more Chaos Emeralds.","Shadow, wait!","I'll be waiting for you, in the central control room, on the Space Colony ARK.","ARK?","Just let it go. You just don't know when to give up, do you?","$#@!","What are you talking about? That emerald's mine! You got that? The Master Emerald contains special powers that neutralize the energy of the Chaos Emeralds. That makes it very powerful.","What the?!","$#@!","Wha? Thief!","Look who's calling who a thief.","I came here following the signal from the emerald. If I'm not mistaken, this is the Master Emerald, is it not?","It's you... Dr. Eggman!","So that's Dr. Eggman.","Well, I guess I can use it for something. I'll just take it with me. Farewell, knucklehead!","Not if I can help it!","AAAAH","What was that all about? And look what you did to my emerald!","I did that to prevent the Master Emerald from being stolen, you idiot! If it's in pieces, I can restore it. And by the way, that's not your emerald!","Hmm. Doesn't matter. I'll look into it once I get back to the base.","I despise anyone who takes jewels from me. All the world's gems are mine to keep!","Yeah, we'll see about that, bat girl!","What?","Those idiots will never find my hidden base inside this pyramid! Let's take care of business here first, then get inside.","With the Chaos Emerald... in the Space Colony ARK... Hmm. I've got to find out just what's going on up there!","We interrupt this broadcast for an important news flash. There has been a break-in at the Federal Reserve bank today. Mysteriously, the only thing that was stolen was the Chaos Emerald.","The Chaos Emerald?!","According to eyewitnesses at the scene, the suspect was identified as the world-renowned hero, Sonic the Hedgehog. The suspect was seen fleeing the scene, destroying the Reserve's guard robots in his path. Stay tuned for more details.","Sounds more like the work of Shadow!","Hm! How pathetic.","*panting*","*panting*","Find them before they escape!","Maria!","*panting* Shadow, I beg of you. Please, do it for me.","Maria...!","For all people, on that planet...","*panting* Sayonara, Shadow... the Hedgehog.","Maria, I still remember what I promised you. For the people of this planet, I promise you... Revenge!","What?","Those robots are a total pain in the...","What?","It all starts with this...","A jewel containing the ultimate power!","That's the... Chaos Emerald!","$#@!","Now I know what's going on!","The military has mistaken me for the likes of you!","So, where do you think you're going with that emerald?","Say something, you fake hedgehog!","Chaos Control!","Wow, he's fast!","$#@!","Hey, it's not his speed!","He must be using the Chaos Emerald to warp!","My name is Shadow. I'm the world's Ultimate Life Form. There's no time for games... Farewell!","Kh! Shadow... what is he?","Don't move! Stay where you are! Keep your hands up in the air!","Huh?","$#@!","Not again...","Shoot!","This is Rouge. I've located Eggman's base and will proceed to enter it now.","*sigh* I hate to say it... I guess I'm going to have to find that key first.","It's a space transporter! The destination has been set to... ARK? Wasn't that space colony shut down over 50 years ago? What's he doing up there, anyway? Doesn't matter! It's my mission to find out what he's up to!","So this is the Space Colony ARK. I have to locate the central control room that Shadow mentioned before he left.","I've been waiting for you, Doctor. Now, I will show the glorious achievement of what the world's leading scientist Professor Gerald has created.","The ARK was the first space colony created by mankind. Not many people know that the ARK contained a top-secret research facility, where weapons of mass destruction were being created. This is one of them; a weapon capable of destroying an entire planet, code-named... the Eclipse Cannon.","Destroying an entire planet?","Was this my grandfather's legacy?","But it's been deactivated for some time now.","To reactivate it...","Large amounts of energy are necessary.","Oh! So that's why we needed the Chaos Emerald.","Exactly! To reactivate the machine, we need the seven Chaos Emeralds. Once you have that, then you have the ultimate power of destruction to use as you please. And then... the world could be yours!","Hahahaha! Sounds like a plan! I like the way you think, Shadow. I will get the Chaos Emeralds, use the machine to dominate the world and build a legacy of my own!","Do you really think it will be that easy?","I've got a great idea! How about making a deal?","A deal?","When you grabbed that huge emerald, you said something about a reaction. A reaction that it may have with the Master Emerald. Now, if you can just let me borrow that radar, I may be able to help you. What do you think?","If I do, what's in it for me?","I have an idea where the other Chaos Emeralds may be. I may not look like it, but do you know that I am a treasure hunter that specializes in all kinds of jewels!","Very well.","Okay then, it's a deal! I don't think we've been introduced. I'm Rouge the Bat, but you can call me Rouge.","We may be partners, but this doesn't mean I trust you.","Bad day or what?","$#@!","$#@!","Having to come back isn't my idea of a vacation! How can you be sure your intelligence reports are correct? Why would the Chaos Emeralds be here on the island? Are you absolutely sure?","Well, believe what you want to believe.","Hm! Very well, very well. Let's discuss how we are going to do this. I will go in first and distract the military troops, allowing you to sneak in the base without being detected. Then, Shadow will...","Enter the armory, where he will set the timer on these dynamite packs. Once that is in place, we will blow up the whole island and get away before anyone has the chance to know what hit them!","Meanwhile, you'll have to sneak into the cargo area and grab the Chaos Emerald. That's a challenge for such a worthy treasure hunter as yourself, isn't it, bat girl?","We only have 30 minutes to pull this mission off, and we only get one try, so don't fail me!","Okay, everyone ready? Shadow, Rouge! On with the show!","Oh Sonic! I thought I'd never see you again! I'm so glad you made it!","You're not Sonic! Who are you?","I'm the one who should be asking that!","Dr. Eggman? AAAAH","Ah! Amy, your timing is impeccable! Leave it to me! I'll take care of her. You two, go!","Give up, Amy!","Boy, am I glad to see you!","Stand back, Amy!","I'm in position, Doctor. Tell me when.","There's been an unexpected delay on my end. There's no more time to waste! Set the timer for 15 minutes! Let's go, Rouge!","Five minutes should be plenty! Here I go!","I can't believe I've come this far, just to fail!","This is Rouge. I've got a small problem. I can't believe that I'm trapped inside this locked safe with a Chaos Emerald! I guess I won't be able to call myself a treasure hunter anymore...","Ah, shoot!","Troublemaker!","What?","*chuckle*","Phew! So far, so good.","Hey, that's...!","That blue hedgehog again, of all places!","I've found you, faker!","Faker? I think you're the fake hedgehog around here. You're comparing yourself to me? Ha! You're not even good enough to be my fake!","I'll make you eat those words!","Shadow, what are you doing? Hurry and get back here right now before the island blows up with you on it!","Blows up?!","Chaos Control!","$#@!","Shadow, what do you think it's like on Earth?","The professor said his life's work was dedicated to all of those who live down there. He once told that the reason for his existence was making people happy through the power of science.","Shadow...","Maria, I just don't know anything anymore. I often wonder why I was created, what my purpose is for being here. Maybe if I go down there... I will find the answers, maybe.","Maria...","Why so melancholy?","That was so unexpected, so unlike you, Shadow, to come and rescue me. But your ability to use the Chaos Control certainly comes in handy!","You know, I didn't come to save you. I came back for the Chaos Emeralds","Yeah, yeah, but then again, that's not the whole story, is it?","Ahem!","Everything is ready to go!","Are you sure? We only have six of the seven Chaos Emeralds, you know.","That's more than enough for the demonstration. So let's get this show on the road!","Well, that was really impressive. You've managed to create complete havoc on the whole planet! Does this now mean we control the planet and can do as we choose?","At this rate, the cannon will take too much time to charge up. If you want to unleash its full potential, you'll need all seven Chaos Emeralds.","Where in the world have you been?","Why are you so upset?","Something happen?","Our threats fell on deaf ears.","Look at you, throwing a tantrum like a little kid! How totally embarrassing!","Don't forget your end of the bargain, bat girl! What about that last Chaos Emerald? We had a deal, right? So where is my emerald?","Here you go. I found this!","Why didn't you show me this before?!","What's this? \"Station Square saved from a life-threatening missile attack. The city has awarded its famed prize to the boy who saved Station Square. Miles 'Tails' Prower was given the Chaos Emerald as a testament of his heroic deed at a ceremony held at city hall.\"","Ahem! This makes things a whole lot easier. Hurry, go back to Earth and find them fast! I want that Chaos Emerald!","$#@!","Did you get that?","Soon enough, Maria.","This is Rouge reporting. Currently, I have not been able to confirm if Shadow is the Ultimate Life Form or not. I will continue my research on Project Shadow and have a follow-up report very shortly. Just a reminder. Don't forget about my jewels!","They got away!","Shadow, they're in that blue plane! Spotted at 11 o' clock.","Copy that. I'm in pursuit.","Doctor, they're heading directly toward us. What should we do?","Just sit tight! I've got them on radar. There's no way they can get away! I don't know what they are planning, but I'll be sure to give them a warm welcome!","*sigh* That was pretty rough!","We did it! Let's go, Amy!","You little thieves! Did you really think you could get out of here alive?","Come and get some, Eggman!","Sonic!","Just leave it to me!","This time, I'll take your lives as well as the Chaos Emerald! I call on you to destroy these pests! Come out, my servant!","Now go! And squash that blue hedgehog Sonic!","Ha!","TERIAA","NOOO","When Sonic struck his head, he must have broken the restraining mechanism.","Agh! What a piece of junk!","Yeah!","Eh?","Whoa!","Whoa!","Hi, Doctor. How's it going? What? What do you mean they escaped? That's okay. I will go after them myself. Can you tell me the password for the space colony control?","Hm! Tricking that old doctor is just too easy! All right, it's time to get to work.","The password is MA-RI-A. Maria, hm? I've heard that name somewhere before... oh well!","This is it! Research Project Shadow, the Ultimate Life Form. Let's see now...","What in the world is this? This can't be right. Just what is Shadow, anyway?","Hm! I guess I'll just have to take the last pieces of the Master Emerald!","Long time no see, treasure hunter! Did you find my emeralds?","That's a good one. Your emerald? Talking to you is a waste of time!","*breathing heavily*","*breathing heavily*","Stop fooling around and give me back my emeralds!","Stop fooling around and give me back my emeralds!","What are you babbling about? You call yourself a hunter? Attacking a lady? Shame on you!","What kind of lady goes around stealing gems, anyway?","Those belong to me... aah!","Keep your hands to yourself! Don't touch me!","Is that how you say thanks to someone who just saved your life?","Saving my life. Don't think I owe you one. You just wanted to hold my hand, didn't you? That's why you saved me. You're such a creep!","This isn't a joke, you know. Think what you want, bat girl. I was saving the Master Emerald!","*sigh* No matter what you say, it sounds crazy!","What?","Fine, then just take them. They stink like echidnas do!","If that's what you thought, you should have given me them in the first place!","Finally!","What?","I'm sorry... if I hurt you.","We should get going.","AAAAH","What in the world?","What's Rouge up to, anyway?","This is strange. It's showing energy readings from two seperate Chaos Emeralds! Did they really think they could trick me with that fake emerald?","Wait, Shadow! I'm the one who should be telling them the end is near, not you!","Now is the time to end this long, drawn-out battle, and mark myself a place in history as the ultimate genius!","If something happens to me, I'm counting on you to finish the job!","Hurry! The moment for attack has come. It's now or never!","Darn! Why do they always leave a sweet little innocent girl like me alone?","Well, well, young lady. Is there something I can help you with?","Dr. Eggman!","If you value your life, you will tell me where Sonic and Tails are!","Let's take care of business first, shall we, Sonic? Hand over the Chaos Emerald, slowly, and then we'll talk about your girlfriend. That is, if you really care for her!","Handing over the fake emerald... I can kill two birds with one stone!","Put the emerald down right there and back off!","You've turned into a big-time villain, Doctor!","You thought you could trick me with that fake emerald, didn't you?","So... how did you know it wasn't the real one?","Tails!","Heh, because you just told me, fox boy!","Now, for a little space ride!","The capsule clears the colony, bam!","I'm counting on you, Tails! And Amy... take care of yourself.","Farewell, Sonic the Hedgehog!","It's not fair, Eggman!","Sonic!","Farewell, Sonic, my admirable adversary...","Soniiiic! *crying*","Now we have some unfinished business to take care of. If you give me the real emerald, I will release you both. You have my promise!","Sonic...","Huh?","Sonic has asked me for the first time to do something for him. I won't let him down! I won't give up!!","Whoa!","Hahahaha","I guess he was just a regular hedgehog, after all.","Legend has it, when all seven Chaos Emeralds are collected, the power creates a miracle. I have six of them! They're mine, all mine!","I don't think so!","Shadow!","So that was your plan from the very beginning, huh? Or was it a direct order from the President? Now I know who you are. You're that government spy, Rouge the Bat, aren't you?","So you did your homework. Is that it? I would say that's an invasion of privacy.","I could say the same thing about you.","Hm! It looks like things aren't quite going your way, but since my job was done, I thought it was time to take what's mine and get out of this place.","You are one pathetic creature!","Hmm. Look who's talking. What about you?","Here are the results of the research project called the Ultimate Life Form. But if this picture is of the real Ultimate Life Form named Shadow...","Then exactly who, or what, is standing in front of me?","This is Dr. Eggman. I have found all seven Chaos Emeralds! Shadow! Someone is trying to get to the Eclipse Cannon. There's not much time left before the cannon fires again. Can you get over there?","If you want to live, leave the Chaos Emeralds where they are. The fake emerald is good enough for you!","Do you actually believe that you're the real Shadow?","No doubt.","Even your memories might not be real, you know?","Even if my memories are not real, it's still me, Shadow. And I will fulfill my promise to Maria. That's the only thing that matters to me now.","You never cease to surprise me, blue hedgehog. I thought that capsule you were in exploded in space.","You know, what can I say? I die hard!","So, there's more to you than just looking like me. What are you, anyway?","What you see is what you get. Just a guy that loves adventure. I'm Sonic the Hedgehog!","I see. But you know, I can't let you live. Your adventuring days are coming to an end!","Hahahaha! This completes my plan to take over the world. Now begins the glorious era of the Empire of Eggman!","HAHAHAHAHAHA","The military's top secret weapon, Project Shadow, was stolen from the military base located on a deserted island in the southern seas. This incident increased worldwide terrorist activities. Sonic the Hedgehog was arrested.","The adventure for truth leads to the incidents that shock the entire world. The story takes our hero, Sonic, from the Earth and into outer space. Sonic Adventure 2: Hero Side Story.","Farewell, Sonic, forever...","Argh! What the... what's going on? Why doesn't the cannon fire?","What? What's happening here?","It's... it's my grandfather. Gerald Robotnik!","What's that, that vibration?","Hey, wait! Someone is coming.","You. You haven't given up yet?","It's all over for us.","What do you mean?","I've just received a message from my boss. The Space Colony ARK is currently approaching the Earth at an incredible velocity.","It... probably...","$#@!","Will impact Earth.","What's that on the screen?","This is a death sentence for every human being on Earth. If my calculations are correct, the Space Colony ARK will impact the Earth in 27 minutes and 53 seconds. All of you will be destroyed, along with your beloved planet Earth!","This is a death sentence for every human being on Earth. If my calculations are correct, the Space Colony ARK will impact the Earth in 27 minutes and 53 seconds. All of you will be destroyed, along with your beloved planet Earth!","I plan to give you a taste of my revenge once all the seven Chaos Emeralds are collected. Once I initiate this program, it cannot be disabled. All of you ungrateful humans who took everything away from me will feel my loss and despair!","$#@!","No.","Is there anything else you want to say?","Ready!","This is a death sentence for every human being on Earth.","Hey, the vibration's getting worse!","What's going on here? Who is that?","Professor Gerald Robotnik, one of the greatest scientific minds in the world, and my grandfather.","What? I knew you were behind all this! Stop it right now, or else...!","I'd have done this a long time ago if I had the chance.","What do you mean?","You're pretty persistent for a hedgehog, aren't you? You're still alive, huh?","Heh! Just letting Knuckles pilot the shuttle on the way over here was more dangerous than you could ever be.","No worries, egghead!","What is this?","This is my grandfather's diary.","\"I don't quite know what happened or what went wrong. Was it a mistake to create the Ultimate Life Form? I thought it would be something that would benefit mankind, but then the military guards landed on the colony that day. They were sent to destroy the research project that I had been working on. My colleagues at the research facility, my granddaughter, Maria, I hope you are all safe.\"","\"The colony was completely shut down, probably to keep the prototype from falling into the wrong hands.\"","The colony was closed down, probably to keep the prototype from falling into the wrong hands. The ARK was shut down under the premise that there had been an accident.","I found Maria's name among those who died when the ARK was shut down. She meant everything to me, and I couldn't bear the thought that she died because of my research. I lost everything. I had nothing more to live for. I went insane. All I could think about was to avenge her, somehow, some way. I got scared as I no longer was able to control my thoughts. All I could think about was that I wanted it all to end.","Based on my original projections, I was able to complete my project: Shadow. I designed its mind to be perfect. Pure. I will leave everything to him. If you wish, release and awaken it to the world!","$#@!","\"If you wish to fill the world with destruction.\" So that's why you released Shadow from the base!","The core of the Eclipse Cannon is now highly reactive and explosive. This is because the energy of the Chaos Emeralds is overpowered. If the colony collides with Earth, it will shatter into pieces like my grandfather predicted. That mad scientist!","$#@!","$#@!","That should be you, right?","We have to stop the space colony now!","The Space Colony ARK position may have shifted due to the amount of energy given off by the emeralds! We have to stop the energy!","But how?","Hmm. That's it! There is a way to stop the energy. We have to use your emerald!","You're the one that told me that the Master Emerald has the power to stop the Chaos Emerald!","That's right! If I use this, I just might be able to stop the Chaos Emerald!","The reaction of the Chaos Emeralds is moving toward the Cannon's Core! It may be too late!","There still may be some time left. If we pull together, we might be able to get to the shortcut that leads to the core!","No worries! Just leave it to me. I'm the world's fastest hedgehog!","Then, let's get to work!","Oooh, I hate it when they leave me behind!","Look. It's Shadow!","I've really got to stop whining. Everyone's trying their best to help out and so must I!","Shadow, we need you! Please help us!","It's all going according to plan. There's no reason for me to help them. Besides, there's no way to save anyone.","There has to be!","I know that people fight over the most trivial things. Some people may be selfish, like the professor said.","But they're basically good, if they try their best and never give up on their wishes.","They always have a reason to be happy. That's why you should help them out. Saving them is a good thing!","Shadow, I beg you. Please do it for them. Give them a chance!","Give them a chance...","Shadow, I beg of you. Please... do it for me. For a better future!","Maria!","For all people who live on that planet...","Give them a chance to be happy!","Let them live for their dreams. Shadow, I know you can do it. That's the reason why you were brought into this world.","Sayonara, Shadow... the Hedgehog.","That's what I've promised her, and I must keep that promise. That's what Maria wished for.","Shadow?","I've got to go now! I have to keep my promise to Maria and you!","What's that? It looks just like the shrine of the Master Emerald!","They probably designed the core like the shrine to harness the power of the Chaos Emeralds!","All of you ungrateful humans who took everything away from me will feel my loss and despair!","Knuckles, here it comes!","Could this be the prototype of the Ultimate Life Form that was supposed to be encapsulated?","There's no time for this!","Leave this one to me.","Shadow, what are you doing?","I'll take care of this while you run to get the Chaos Emeralds!","$#@!","*roar*","The servers are the seven Chaos. Chaos is power. Power is enriched by the heart.","The controller is the one that unifies the Chaos. Only you can do this. Stop the Chaos Emeralds!","*roar*","*roar*","Is it gone?","Is that what Chaos Control is?","Since we've stopped the Chaos Emeralds, why is the space colony still on a crash-course with Earth?","The prototype is still alive and he's controlling the space colony as it's falling to Earth! He's become one with the space colony and is determined to keep it on its collision course!","Sonic!","The space colony is still accelerating toward Earth. In five minutes, there will be no way to stop it.","Nothing can stop the colony now...","Mr. President, don't give up just yet! Sonic and his friends can still help us!","I've located the two hedgehogs. They're in the lower quadrant. The space colony has entered the Earth's atmosphere and is accelerating.","That's ridiculous! There's no way two hedgehogs can stop the colony now.","They can! I believe in them. Together, they can do it, I just know it!","No way that's getting through!","Go for it, Sonic!","Shadow, we're counting on you!","I'm counting on both of you!","Go for it Sonic, Shadow!","Shadow, I beg of you...","Give them a chance to be happy!","Maria!","Now, Shadow!","Chaos Control!","Chaos Control!","Maria, this is what you wanted, right? This is my promise I made to you.","There's an emergency message from the space bureau. They are tracking the space colony's re-entry trajectory and it seems to have reappeared in quadrant L1.","You know, when I was a kid, I used to dream about heroes like them, and their heroic deeds.","Mr. President, that's why you should be like them. Never give up believing in your dreams.","Where is Shadow?","Do you really think that the professor created him- Shadow, to carry out the revenge on all those who live here on Earth?","He was what he was: a brave and heroic hedgehog, who gave his life to save this planet. Shadow the Hedgehog.","I guess you're right.","As a child, I looked up to my grandfather because of all the great things he accomplished in his life. He was my hero, and I wanted to be a great scientist like him, but... did he really mean to destroy us?","I don't know, but what I do know is...","We all did it together!","You're right.","Where are you going?","Next time, I will pull this off without anyone's help! I will use my own power to take over the world.","Next time we meet, all bets are off!","Same here!","So what's next for you, Rouge? Off again to find those jewels you love so much?","Nah, I think I'm going to give up this line of work. Too much work for too little pay!","Anyway, I've got something better than jewels that I'm thinking about right now...","It'll all work out, you'll see.","If you say so.","Created the Ultimate Life Form...","What's the matter, Sonic?","Oh, it's nothing. Come on! Let's go home! To the planet as cool and blue as me!","Sayonara, Shadow the Hedgehog...","Let me tell you about the special action for Knuckles and Rouge.","There are quite a few special actions for both of them. Try mastering them all!","This is attack action.","Knuckles' specialty is punching, while Rouge's is kicking.","Press B button and try it!","Try the different actions available when you press B button multiple times, or press it while running.","Try breaking wooden containers with this!","Knuckles and Rouge both have the special ability to glide.","While in mid-jump, press and hold A button to glide.","You can only glide downwards. Gliding upwards is not possible!","To stop gliding, release A button to drop.","Knuckles and Rouge can scale any wall with ease.","To grab onto a wall, just glide into it or use forward and A button.","Once you've grabbed onto the wall, use the analogue thumbpad to move.","If a wall or overhang is a 90 degree angle, you cannot scale it.","Knuckles and Rouge are also good swimmers.","Jump into the water and press B button to dive underwater.","Underwater, press A button to swim up and B button to swim down.","Remember to come up for breaths of air. You cannot stay under forever!","Knuckles digs with his hands, and Rouge digs with her feet.","This is easy to master! Just press B button while jumping or gliding.","Use Y button to change the action window. Select \"Dig\" and you can burrow where you are standing.","One more important thing.","If you are scaling a wall, you can dig into it by pressing B button.","Besides the emeralds, there are a lot of items buried undergroud. Make sure you dig to find them all!","If you find the Iron Gloves or Boots, your punches and kicks are stronger!","You can break the steel containers with this!","This is a very useful Level-Up Item!","Use Y button to change the action window, then press B button to use the glasses.","The Sunglasses will allow you to see things you couldn't before. It may even help you locate the emeralds quicker!","If you use them, you'll be able to see things you couldn't before!","Try using it in different places!","If you want to take them off, just press A button to jump.","You found something really cool!","Try using it in the water. It will let you breathe underwater.","Now you have nothing to be afraid of.","The number of special actions for Knuckles and Rouge will increase when you find more Level-Up Items.","Let me explain Knuckles and Rouge's 2P Versus mode.","The rules are simple. The first one to find two of the three hidden emeralds is the winner!","Pay close attention to your opponent's hint messages and radar, as it may help you locate the emeralds.","Let me start by explaining the actions for Sonic and Shadow.","Homing Attack!","Press A button to jump and again while in midair to do the Homing Attack against your enemies.","The best way to defeat the enemy!","Somersault! This is a brand-new action for Sonic. Use B button to Somersault.","The Somersault can be used to defeat enemies, break wooden containers, and get through tight spaces.","Try Spin Dash to run at supersonic speed!","Press and hold B button to charge up, then release the button to do the Spin Dash.","The Spin Dash is very fast! Practice using the technique and use it wisely.","Grinding! This is also a brand-new Sonic action.","Grind down anything that resembles a rail. Give it a try!","Find a rail and sport a grind!","Remember to keep your character upright as possible to maintain speed and to avoid falling off the rail.","If you find the Level-Up Item, then you can do the Light Dash!","The Light Dash is a very useful action. It allows you to quickly move along ring paths.","As you get close to a row of rings, the action window will open and all you do is press B button!","Use the Light Attack to defeat many enemies quickly!","Hold B button to charge up, then release B button once you're fully charged.","We haven't figured out where it's best used, though. It's a very dangerous special attack!","Bounce Attack!","While in mid-jump, press B button and bounce like a rubber ball.","Use this attack for enemies below you, or to reach places too far for a regular jump.","Power-up version of the Somersault: the Fire Somersault. Use it to break steel containers.","Sonic is the only one who can use this special technique called the Magic Hand. It turns enemies into small balls!","Use Y button to select the action window. Press B button to pull in the closest enemy.","Once the enemy is turned into a ball, throw it at enemies far away. Pretty cool, huh?","Try turning different kinds of enemies into balls. It's fun!","A mysterious melody indeed. Use Y button to select the action window, then press B button to play a melody.","What's it used for?","Well, that's a secret!","Try playing it in front of something and watch what happens.","Actually, the number of special actions for each character will increase if you find more Level-Up Items.","You don't know what a Level-Up Item is?","Somewhere in each stage are hidden Level-Up Items. There are also power-up items, as well.","Find the item and I will tell you more about the action.","Try learning how to use them all to increase your score.","Let me tell you about the Sonic and Shadow 2P Versus mode.","The rules are simple. The first one to the Goal Ring is the winner!","One more thing.","There are very special attacks used only in the Versus mode.","Special attacks are awarded after collecting 20, 50, and 100 rings.","Once you have the special attack, the action window will appear onscreen. Press B button to use the attack.","The more rings you collect, the more special attacks you can use.","Special attacks are awarded after collecting 20, 40, and 60 rings.","Let me explain Tails and Eggman's special actions.","By using the homing missile, you can defeat multiple enemies.","Activate the homing laser by holding down B button.","Use the analogue thumbpad to lock on the enemies.","Once you have locked on, release B button to fire the homing missiles.","Try locking onto multiple enemies with the homing laser. More the better!","Defeating multiple enemies with a single lock-on scores you technique points.","But it's important to remember this.","The aiming laser and lock-on only last a few seconds before they disappear. Fire quickly!","Besides the homing missile, you also have a powerful Vulcan Missile.","Just press B button to fire it.","Use the Vulcan Missile to destroy items that you cannot lock onto.","The most important Level-Up action is Hovering.","Holding down A button will allow you to hover over short distances.","Use it to fly over short distances or to slowly descend down.","Release A button to drop.","This is the power-up version of the Vulcan Missile.","This will allow you to break steel containers that you couldn't before.","This is the power-up item for the homing missile.","After it hits an enemy, the missile scatters and will take out nearby items and enemies.","This is a special device only used to power up Eggman's plane.","The health meter is now increased two points!","Makes clearing stages a breeze!","The number of Tails' actions will increase as you find more Level-Up Items during the action stages.","Let me tell you about Tails and Eggman's 2P Versus mode.","The rules are simple: Attack your opponent until his health is gone. That's it!","But remember, your opponent will be shooting homing missiles at you!","The homing missiles will home in on you, so remember to use the walls and springs to avoid them.","Try locking on to your opponent while avoid his homing missiles.","Here's the controller configuration!","Move your character using the analogue thumbpad.","Press A button to jump.","Action assigned to B button differs depending on the character you choose. Each character has their own special actions.","What special actions?","The action window in the upper-right corner indicates what action is performed with B button.","Actions include Whistle, Pick Up, Throw, and Look. In 2P Versus mode, B button can be used for the special attack. These will automatically appear in the action window.","Try different actions with different items.","And don't forget about Y button. It's important, too!","Pressing Y button allows you to change the action display.","I almost forgot. X and B buttons are the same. Use either one you like!","Use L/R triggers to change the camera angle.","Let's not forget Start button!","Press this button to pause your game.","From the pause menu, you'll be able to either exit the game or restart the stage.","Did you get all of that?","That's all!","Knuckles and Rouge's games are treasure hunting games.","You have to find the three pieces of the Master Emerald in each stage.","Use the radar and hints to find them.","The radar is at the bottom of the screen. When you get close to the emerald, the color of the light becomes red.","Hints are also useful in finding emeralds.","Touchscreen monitors will give you up to three hints for each emerald.","If you forget the hint, just pause the game and they will be displayed.","The number of hints you use is key.","Fewer hints you use in finding the emeralds, the higher the score you'll get.","Quickly find the emeralds without the hints to earn rank-up points.","Hi! I'm Omochao. Let me be your guide. Select the category that you would like to explore.","Select!","Press A button to confirm your selection.","Press B button to go back to the previous screen.","What happened?","Let me tell you about Sonic and Shadow's game.","Let me tell you about Sonic and Shadow's game.","Let me tell you about Eggman and Tails' game.","Let me tell you about Eggman and Tails' game","Let me tell you about Knuckles and Rouge's game.","Let me tell you about Knuckles and Rouge's game.","Let me tell you about Chao.","Let me tell you about the basic controls used for all characters.","Sonic and Shadow's games are high-speed 3D action games.","The rules are simple: make your way to the center of the screen and the first to touch the Goal Ring clears the stage.","After clearing the stage, a ranking screen will appear with time and score.","Your score is based on enemies destroyed, rings collected, and tricks performed.","Fast, and with a little style of your own. This is how you get rank-up points!","Most important are the rings!","Taking damage without having any rings will end your game, but you knew that already.","Get as may rings as you can! Don't forget!","Don't forget about the action link!","In certain places, you can perform action combos to score technique points.","Story Select.","Scene select.","Character select.","Stage select.","Type select.","Records.","Group select.","Game select.","$#@!","Options.","Sound Test.","Access to the world.","File select.","System alert.","Congratulations.","World Ranking.","Emblem records.","Kart Racing.","Download events.","Theme select.","TV setting.","Access to the database.","Please wait.","Select a story!","Select a story.","$#@!","Select a story.","Select a story.","Select a story.","Select a story.","Select a story.","Which story do you wish to try?","Which story do you wish to try, Mr. President?","Select your story!","Select a story.","Select a scene.","Select a scene.","$#@!","Which scene do you want to start?","Select a scene.","Select a scene.","Select a scene.","Next, select a scene.","Please choose a scene.","Please choose a scene, Mr. President.","Which scene do you want to start from?","Where do you want to start from?","Select your character!","Select a character.","$#@!","Select me!","Select a character.","Select a character.","Who are you going to be?","Who will you be?","Please choose a character.","Please choose a character, Mr. President.","Who do you want to be?","Choose a character.","Select a fun stage!","Select a stage.","$#@!","Select a stage.","Select a stage.","Select a stage.","Decide which stage to go to.","Select a stage.","Is this the stage you would like to go to?","Is this the stage you would like to go to, Mr. President?","Select a stage.","What stage are we going to play?","Which one do you want?","Which one would you like?","$#@!","Which game?","Which game do you want to play?","Select one from here.","Which story?","Which one?","Which story are you interested in?","Which story are you interested in, Mr. President?","Choose one.","Choose something good!","Want to look at your results?","Check on your results here.","$#@!","I saved your results so far.","Check your results.","I will tell you how to save.","This is the database.","Remember to save this.","Please take a look at your past results.","Please take a look at your past results, Mr. President.","You can check your results if you want.","Let's peek at the results!","Good guy, or bad guy?","Want to be the hero, or villain?","$#@!","You better choose the dark side!","Are you a good guy or a bad guy?","Which do you like?","Which side do you want?","Hero?

I'll find Eggman and the Chaos Emeralds!","First, I have to find a safe place to hide.","My name is Rouge the Bat, better known as the treasure hunter, Rouge.","I got inside the military research facility, just as the Doctor planned it.","I need to find the three remaining Chaos Emeralds. This should be a piece of cake!","My name is Rouge the Bat, better known as the treasure hunter, Rouge.","A minor setback. *sigh* Just how could I have let this happen to me?","After collecting the three Chaos Emeralds, something caught my eye. All of a sudden...","The security alarm went off, and I was trapped inside the safe!","From out of nowhere comes this strong-looking fighter. There's not much time left before the bomb that Shadow set goes off! This is just not my day.","First, I've got to take care of business!","I'm Shadow the Hedgehog, the one and only Ultimate Life Form.","Looks like bat girl has failed her end of the deal.","I really could care less about her. It's the Chaos Emeralds I have to save.","I have to hurry because there's not much time left before the bomb goes off.","I'm Shadow the Hedgehog, the one and only Ultimate Life Form.","That other hedgehog appeared while I was on my way to rescue Rouge.","He's starting to irritate me!

Sonic's escaping!","My name is Rouge the Bat, better known as the treasure hunter, Rouge.","But that's not all I do!","Finally, those guys appeared when I returned from my secret mission.","That means they've collected the remaining pieces of the Master Emerald.

What's going on?","They must be planning a counterattack!","I've got no time to waste. Back to the space colony, to attack them!","I'm Knuckles the Echidna. Just call me Knuckles.","Following the signal from the Master Emerald, I found myself deep inside this canyon.","This place looks like a deserted mine of some kind.

No time to complain about it!","I have to find the pieces of the Master Emerald quickly!","I'm Dr. Eggman, the greatest scientific genius of the world!","Hahaha! I finally did it! I've defeated Sonic! That annoying hedgehog is now gone forever! He's nothing but floating chunks in space now!","What are you going to do now, Tails?

Now the stage is set. I'm almost finished!","All this time, someone has been trying to get at the Eclipse Cannon. There's no hope for him now!","It's important we don't make any mistakes right now. I have to get rid of all those pests!","I'm Shadow the Hedgehog, the one and only Ultimate Life Form.","It's that blue hedgehog that's trying to destroy the Eclipse Cannon!","I'm impressed. I thought he died in the capsule that was shot into space.","Now I know that blue hedgehog is dangerous!","When I'm finished with him, he'll wish he died in the capsule. I'm going to show him my real power!","My name is Miles Prower, but everyone calls me Tails.","I tracked the signal from the Chaos Emeralds and located Eggman.","What's Eggman doing in outer space?","No worries! I've got to find the exact location of Eggman and quick!","No worries, Amy! Remember I'm a wiz when it comes to mechanical things.","I'll find the President!","My name is Miles Prower, but everyone calls me Tails.","We rode in the President's limo, and guess what? We found where Eggman is hiding!","Eggman and his buddies are in the Space Colony ARK.","Next step is to find Eggman's secret pyramid base, somewhere in the desert.","Got it! I'll go first and find the entrance.","I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!","We managed to sneak into the pyramid and find Eggman's secret base.","There's got to be a way to get to outer space from here. We don't have much time. Let's go!","I'm Knuckles the Echidna. Just call me Knuckles.","We were able to locate Eggman's secret base, deep inside the pyramid.","Now we need to find the key to open the door to get to the other side.","What? Why do I have to find that key? That's not my job, but I'll do it. I have to because it's for the Master Emerald.","I'll show you the skills that make me the ultimate treasure hunter!","I'm Knuckles the Echidna. Just call me Knuckles.","That was a piece of cake. I found the key and now it's time to explore Eggman's secret base!","What was that? I got a bad feeling about this. It's creepy in here. Could there be spirits that guard the tombs?","I don't think I can deal with this, but then how am I going to find the pieces of the emerald? Darn... I have no choice!","I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!","Thanks to Knuckles, we were able to unlock the door to Eggman's secret base.","Out of nowhere, Eggman appeared, and a huge statue came alive!","That evil egghead! How did he know we were coming?","Do you really think that piece of rock can stop us?","My name is Miles Prower, but everyone calls me Tails.","We managed to hotwire the space shuttle from Eggman's secret base, and finally arrived at the Space Colony ARK.","It was my idea to destroy that weapon using the fake emerald I made.","I wonder if Sonic understands the plan.","It's up to me to find the power supply and fast!","I'm Knuckles the Echidna. Just call me Knuckles.","The pieces of the Master Emerald I collected are now floating in space. We should have secured them better in the shuttle cargo bay.","It's not an easy job protecting the Master Emerald, you know!","I have to find them before we lose them again!","My name is Amy Rose. I'm cute and full of energy!","Something horrible is happening. Professor Gerald activated this program a long time ago.","Activating that program has caused the space colony to fall out of its orbit. Now it's on a crash-course with the Earth!","Looks like Eggman has tricked Shadow.","He's such an evil doctor! I want to yell at him, but first, we need to stop the space colony from falling.","We decided to team up and go to the colony's core to stop the power of the Chaos Emeralds.","We don't have much time left! Hang on, everybody! Let's do it!","I'm Shadow the Hedgehog, the one and only Ultimate Life Form.","Thanks to Amy, I was able to remember Maria's wish.","When I finally realized it, the ultimate life prototype tried to stop me!","I'll take care of this, Sonic! You go try to stop the power of the Chaos Emeralds.","I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!","We were able to stop the power of the Chaos Emeralds, but the space colony is still falling!","That prototype has become one with the space colony and is heading it on a collision course with Earth.","That prototype has become one with the space colony and is heading it on a collision course with Earth.","The space colony will be entering the Earth's atmosphere soon.

No time for small talk; I won't give her the chance!","I've got to get those pieces back!","I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!","Our plan was perfect... until Eggman snatched Amy.","Eggman said he'll trade us Amy for the emerald. I have to think about that one!","There's no time for jokes! Eggman's ready to fire that weapon again!","Tails, Amy! Hold on! I'm coming!","My name is Miles Prower, but everyone calls me Tails.","Sonic was captured and put in that capsule.

I'll make you pay for this!","I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!","I took a chance using Chaos Control and managed to escape from Eggman's trap.","There's not much time left before the weapon fires again!","I'll take my chances and throw this emerald into the cannon before it fires!","I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog!","Timing couldn't be worse! Just when I thought I had everything under control, Shadow showed up.

This is really weird.","What was that all about?","I don't think I'm dreaming here.","Hm?","Eggman!","What's he doing here?","Oh nevermind; this time I'll get him good!","Well; if it isn't my pal; Sonic.","I'm surprised you made it this far.","Hold it right there; Eggman!","What's up; Knuckles?","Something buggin' you?","No time for games; Sonic.","Give me the Emeralds you have; right now!","What? Let's just see you take them.

Mayday; mayday!","Going down!","Ahhhh!","Look out below!","Boy; you're lucky I saw you come down.","So what went wrong; anyway?","It's not like you to crash like that.","Yeah; it's just that I'm testing a new prototype power supply; and it's not fully compatible yet.","You can always borrow my plane; the Tornado; if you want.","Thanks Sonic; but if I can make this work; it'll run circles around yours!","Check out this power supply!","It's a Chaos Emerald! No way!","I was lucky to find one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.","They have unlimited mystic power.","Now I wanna harness that power to fly my plane.","Let's go to my workshop in the Mystic Ruins and I'll show you what I've been working on.","We'll go to the station; hop on a train; and get there in no time!","Well; well; well; if it isn't Sonic and Tails.","It's Eggman!","Silence!","I am Dr. Robotnik; the most cunning scientific genius in the world!","Yeah; right; Dr. Eggman!","Enough! I've been working on a master plan; but now it's time to put it to work!","That usually means trouble; coming from you!","Don't even try to interfere this time!","Give me that Chaos Emerald; or else!","Or else what; huh?","Or else I'll take it from you; the hard way!","That was just too easy!","Gotcha!","Hey; he snagged it!","Chaos could use a little snack!","Who's Chaos?","That's the monster I saw the other day.","Uh; monster?","Yes; yes; yes; it's really happening; just as the stone tablets said it would!","Ha ha ha ha; hear this Sonic!","Chaos' strength increases every time I give him a Chaos Emerald.","All he needs is seven Emeralds to become invincible.","Then; he will turn Station Square into rubble!","Upon which I will build the ultimate city; Robotnikland!","Ha ha ha ha!

We can't let them get away!","Let's get to my workshop and we'll take the Tornado!","Yeah.","You guys go.","I have some unfinished business to take care of.","No problem Knuckles.","We'll take care of everything here.","Come on! Let's get going!","Sonic! Wait here for a second.","Sonic; hop in!","Let's go!","We did it!","Way to go; Tails!","Mn... Wow; that dream brought back memories.","I owe so much to Sonic.","Sonic!","Hmm... Wonder where he went?\nSure hope he's alright.","The Tornado's not powerful enough.","If I'm gonna get that Egg Carrier; I need to finish my prototype.","It needs a Chaos Emerald to work!","Looks like I'd better find one; fast!","Wow! There's a Chaos Emerald!","Hey! Wait up!","Sstop!","Uh-oh. I thought I was in the desert!","I wonder where I am.","Oops!","The servers are the seven Chaos Emeralds.","Hello there friend! How are you?","Um; what were you saying before?","Huh.","It's something my grandmother taught me.","I'm never to forget it. It goes like this.","The servers are the Seven Chaos.","Chaos is power; power enriched by the heart.","The controller is the one that unifies the chaos.","But I'm still not sure what it all means.","But the number seven...","...is the same as the number of Emeralds there are.","Emeralds?","Forgive me; but I don't think we've ever met before.","I'm Tikal. And you are?","Wwhooa!","Yikes!!","Wait for me!!","Weird... Now where was I?","Oh yeah; the Chaos Emerald. Perfect!","This will get my Tornado 2 up and rarin' to go!","The time has come at last.","This new plane should work a lot better.

The Egg Carrier!","There's Sonic!","Soonic!","Alright; Tails! Way to go! This plane's cool!","Now what'ya say we nail those guys?","You got it! Hang on!","Hah-hah! So far so good!","Hope you know what you're doing.","You bet! Watch this!","Sonic! Tails!","Hah! You're a bit late!","Not the birdie!","That's a Chaos Emerald!","No way!","Be gone; all of you! This is all I really need.","Gamma!","What is your wish; Master?","Get rid of these pests!","Give them all you got!","Aye-aye; Master Robotnik.","I'll leave it up to you; Gamma.","Please stop; Tails!","Move aside Amy.

This ship is losing altitude!","Hurry Tails! Take Amy and get outta here!","But what about you?","I'll find Eggman and put a stop to his evil ways!","That's Eggman! I wonder what happened to Sonic?","I'm finished... Chaos was defeated; and now my Egg Carrier is ruined.","No matter. I will destroy Station Square anyway.","*scream*","(Japanese)","If that missile is launched...","Ready? Fire!","Augh! No; it was a dud!","I can't believe this!","Ahh! I'll go and deal with this myself!","Oh no!","I'd better get to that missile before he detonates it!","I see it!","I've gotta get it before Eggman!","The fate of Station Square depends on me... (sighs)","So-nic...","I've changed a lot since I've started hanging with Sonic.","But I can't depend on him forever.","I know I can do this by myself. Okay Eggman; bring it on!","So you beat me to the missile; you little pest.","I will make you all pay for this.","You fool. Away... before I make mincemeat out of you.","I'm not scared. I'm not scared.","I can do this!","Oh no! It's Robotnik!","*screams*","Let's get out of here!","Hey! I did it!","Heh... I did it all by myself!","You're the best!","(empty)","We're forever grateful.","(empty)","You saved the day!","Coming in tight!","Tails! We gotta land on the Egg Carrier.","Oops!","We got a problem here!","What now?","I forgot to put in the landing gear!","Whaaa?!!","Gee; I'm bored.","Everyday's the same old thing.","Same place; different day.","I miss the good ol' days.","Hanging out with my hero; Sonic! (sighs)","Chasin' bad guys...","And blowing 'em away! Haha!","But now he's gone. And there's nothing left to do...","...But shop 'til I drop. There was always something fun to do with Sonic around.

I guess I'll let him go then.","The Egg Carrier's losing altitude!","We're fresh out of time! Take Amy and clear out; fast!","What about you?","I'll nail that Eggman! Can't let him escape!","I knew you would save me Sonic! You're my hero!","Uh; you okay?","It's dangerous here!","Don't pay attention to Eggman anymore.

I need to get out of this place!","I wonder what Sonic is doing.","He's always rescuing me; it seems.","I should be more independent!","You know; you sure surprised me; by having a Chaos Emerald with you.","No wonder they were after you; my feathered friend!","Hey; a pendant! Wow.","So I'll help you find your family.","Does Eggman have them captive now?","I bet he does!","So I'll help you find your family!","I've come this far; I may as well go all the way!","That robot said Dr. Eggman's base is in the Mystic Ruins.","So what d'ya say we check it out?","Hmm... I don't remember this bridge.","Looks dangerously suspicious!","Wanna go?","(gasps) Not you again!","Phoaw! That was a close one!","I saw no sign of your reletives; Birdie.","Ooh! You escaped from the Egg Carrier!","So maybe your family's still in there!","Let's investigate! Wanna?","Yay; it's them!","*gasp*","Oh no! Are you okay?","You idiot! How could you do this?","Now you're gonna get it!","Please wake up; Birdie.","Are you okay? Can you fly?","Whoa!","You did it! Now you three can live in peace again!","I'm so happy!","I'm going to try my best too!","Just watch me!","I'll make that Sonic respect me!","And by that time it's gonna be too late! *kiss*","As far back as I can remember; I've been living here on this dark island.","Always guarding the Master Emerald; from anything that could harm it.","I don't know why I was given this job; why it was my fate.","Destined to be here; forever.","What the!?","What's going on here?","Oh no!","Something's happened to the Master Emerald!","Huh? Who are you?","Did you do this? Oh; I'll get you for this!","Ooph!","Auh! Euh! Hey; no fair!","Wait!","What's happening to you? Come back here!","Whoa; that was incredible. I've never seen anything like it.","Oh no; it's starting to happen.","Without the Master Emerald's power; this whole island will fall into the ocean!","It's up to me to find the missing pieces of the Master Emerald.","It won't be easy. Pieces flew off everywhere.","Guess I better start looking anywhere I can.","Where in the world am I?","I don't remember being here before...","But something about it... is familiar.","Hmm... This is very strange.","Father; please don't!","Tikal; the seven Emeralds are essential to our survival.","It is for the good of all our people.","How can I make you understand?","Attacking other countries; stealing; and killing...","...Can't be the right path to peace!","No one has the right to take their holy grounds.","I beg you; father!","Unh? Now where am I?","Back in Station Square I see.","What's going on here anyway?","Eggman! Give me back the Master Emerald.","Kn- Knuckles!","Uh; this isn't what you're after!.","(gasps) You're right.","That's okay though. I can use you as a guinea pig to test it.","Chaos! Chaos!","Chaos?","It's that creature again!","The same one I saw on my island.","He was there when the Master Emerald shattered. I'm sure of it.","He saved me the trouble of looking for him.

So what if you won this time?","You have yet to see the true powers of Chaos.","Yeah; yeah. That still doesn't phase me;\nyou hear?","I know something that might.","It's about Sonic.","What?!","What about Sonic?","He's after the pieces of the Master Emerald too!","What do you mean?","You're not the only one on a wild goosechase; idiot! Why should I ruin your surprise?","Ah ha hahahaha!","I wonder what he meant by that? I better find Sonic.","I wonder why Sonic is after the Master Emerald...","I'd better work fast and get to the bottom of this.","(gasp) There's Sonic! Eggman was right.","What's that in his hand? It looks like a piece of the Master Emerald!","He has no right to have that.","Hey; Knuckles!","Whoa! What do you think you're doing?","Alright. Put 'em up!","Hand over the Emerald now.","That's not gonna happen; buddy!","Oh no! The Chaos Emeralds!","Mwuahahahahahahahahaha!","Eggman! What's he doing here?","Uh oh.","Heh. That's all there is to it. You guys are too easy!","(gasp) That's... a Chaos Emerald!","First come; first serve; they say.","And you serve me too well for your own good. Hahahaha...","You can't get away with this!","Knuckles; did you let him trick you again?","Like you wern't?","Smooth move; Knucklehead!","Hahahahaha! I've got four Emeralds now.","Here; Chaos...","Come here; my hungry pet.","Now look what he is!","No problem! I'll make him eat dirt!","Behold my flying fortress!

What're we waiting for?","My workshop's close; so let's take the Tornado and go after him!","Good idea!","Hey Sonic!","You go on without me. I have some things I need to take care of.","No problem Knuckles.","We'll take care of everything here.","Let's move!","I beg of you; hear me now.","My father is coming here soon.","And I fear what may happen.","You must take everyone away from here.","Oh please!","So; are you saying you can't leave this place?","I understand. Let me talk to my father again.","There must be a better way to do this.","Don't worry; my friends. I won't let you down.","I must do something; quickly!","Where am I?","This is very strange.","(pant) (pant) What? I'm back in front of the alter!","This is beginning to blow my mind.","Wait a minute; I remember!","The broken pieces of the Master Emerald!","I have to restore them to where they belong!","It's still incomplete!","I need to find the remaining pieces; wherever they are.","Hey... Look! It's Eggman's flying fortress!","That's where the rest of the pieces must be!","But I don't know where that ship is.","Hey; isn't that one of Eggman's robots?","I know! I'll follow it back to Eggman's base.","Here I come; Eggman!","Hmm. Just what I thought.","Time to make a housecall.","Now we'll see who's so easily tricked.","I can sense that the Emeralds are here somewhere.","Uh! What's going on?","Ahh! This thing's always changing!","I sense the Master Emerald.","It can't be far from here.","The last missing piece!

What happened here?","I couldn't... stop them...","They came... and my father...","I had no idea... how bad this would turn out...!","I'm shocked...!","Look! It's the Emerald!","Wait!","Is this a dream?","It's more like a nightmare.","Augh! Not again! I hate you!","Hey Sonic!","There you are Knuckles! About time.","I will return!","Eggman; come back!","I'd better let Sonic handle it from here. He'll do okay.","Now; I must return to Angel Island. And; the Master Emerald.","No! It can't be!","I guess he didn't get enough the first time.","You can't stop me from restoring the Master Emerald.","I finally found all of the missing Emerald pieces;\nbut...","I still can't figure out that creepy monster.","Huh? What's that?","Yeah! You're finished!","What's left now is to return the Master Emerald to my island.","This should do it. Perfect! All is well now.","The Master Emerald; and the island; have been retored.","I'll probably be on this floating island forever.","Guarding the Master Emerald again.","I may not know the whole story behind this...","But perhaps it's better that way.
