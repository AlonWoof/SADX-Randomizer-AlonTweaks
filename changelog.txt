V2.0

Welcome to the new randomized update! The mod got a complete refactoring, take a look!

General:
- The RNG is now generated as soon as you start the game, this should fix a lot of previous bugs.
- You don't need a specific number of emblems to finish a story anymore, everything is based on beating a specific number of stage and boss. No more frustration if you missed those 50 rings.
- Speedruners can now get splits depending on the seed used. To do that, simply select the Randomizer in SADX Mod manager, click on "Configure..." then select which category you would like splits for. Then click on "Save & Play" The splits will be generated at the root of the game folder.
- SA2 Randomized Missions are here, you can now randomly get a special goal for a stage. For example, you will have to find a lost Chao, or collect 100 rings and more! get ready for a new experience!
- All the stages have been reworked to improve the experience.
- Randomized AI is now possible, a random character will follow you just like like Tails follows Sonic.
- You can swap the character with the AI in most of the area, just like in Sonic Heroes, by pressing the Y button. Keep in mind that it doesn't work with Big, Gamma and Knuckles atm.
- The Randomizer mod is now compatible with Dreamcast Conversion mod and SADX Fixed Edition. Make sure to put the Randomzer at the bottom of the mod list to avoid any conflict.
- Random music has been improved, Unused music files in SADX have been added to the song list, there is also a new option called "consistent music".
- A summary of the current options has been added to the character select menu.
- If you play on PC disc (PC 2004), you can now soft reset during the credits (alt+f2) without losing your progression, this should make All Stories faster.
- You will now get a "Final Statistics" at the end of a run, it will display few stuff like your number of kills, hits etc.

New Stage/Character combination:
- Twinkle Circuit has been added, you can now get a different version of this stage, which aren't available in the game originally. (Unused game files.)
- Amy's Final Egg has been added for every character.
- Big's Hot Shelter has been added for every character.
- Gamma's Windy Valley has been added for every character.
- Gamma's Red Mountain has been added for every character.
- Gamma's Emerald Coast has been added for every character.
- Tails's Sky Deck has been added for every character.
- Tails's Windy Valley has been added for every character.
- Tails's Speed Highway has been added for every character, you will have to race Eggman as well, except for Big.

Bug fixes:

- The rocket in Tails's Casinopolis as Big has been fixed.
- Gamma should now longer get bumped after hitting egg viper. (This is a different fix than the original bump which has been fixed in the previous update.)
- Fixed a bug where RNG wasn't the same for people using the same seed. (oops lol.)
- Fixed a bug where Sonic Layout was taking priority over the actual character after a while, making some stages impossible to beat. (oops lol.)
- Fixed a bug where Zero was spawning Twice.
- Zero should no longer spawn in the Sonic version of Final Egg.
- Randomizer should now display the correct goal for each mission.
- Credits should no longer start when you pick a new story.
