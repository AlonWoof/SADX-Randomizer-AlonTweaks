# SADX Randomizer 

Sonic Adventure DX Randomizer is a mod for the PC Disc and Steam version (with PKR's SADX Mod Installer) of Sonic Adventure DX. This mod load random characters into random stages in a random order with some custom layout to make them beatable.

DC Mod is now fully compatible with Randomizer, as long as the Rando is loaded AFTER DC mod. Which means it should be at the end of your mod list. 

Note: You can change the settings according to your play style. (sa2 missions, disable a character, speed...)

Download
--------

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Sora-yx/SADX-Randomizer/releases).

Installation:

Set up the mod:

1) Download and Install [SADX MOD manager](http://mm.reimuhakurei.net/sadxmods/SADXModLoader.7z) (If you are using the Steam version, do not use that link, you must install [PKR's installer](https://dcmods.unreliable.network/owncloud/data/PiKeyAr/files/Setup/sadx_setup.exe), which will also install the Mod Manager.)
2) Copy the "Randomizer" folder in the "mods" folder from your SADX folder.
3) You can configure the mod by selecting different settings. Open the SADX mod manager, select "Randomizer" in the Mods list, then Click on "Configure..." It is recommended to keep "have all upgrades" activated, since upgrades help to finish some specific stage or boss.
4) If you want to race with a friend, make sure both of you are using the same "seed" in the settings, also make sure the seed used is different than "0". (0 makes the rng always different, when using another number makes it consistent.)

How to use:

Once you are done with the settings (randomize music, disable characters...) Start the game, create a new savefile and select Sonic, then enjoy the show! 
A story ends once you beat a specific number of stages, which now include bosses, depending on the character selected.  
Enjoy!
