# SADX Randomizer 

Sonic Adventure DX Randomizer is a mod for the PC version of SADX. This mod load random characters into random stages in a random order with some custom layout to make them beatable.
Big in Speed Highway? Amy vs Egg Viper? Sonic in Hot Shelter? Yeah, this is happening!

Note: You can change the settings according to your play style. (SA2 missions, disable a character...) You can also swap Character and AI by pressing the Y button, just like in Sonic Heroes.

Note about Dreamcast Conversion mod: DC mod is now fully compatible with Randomizer, as long as the Rando is loaded AFTER DC mod. Which means it should be at the end of your mod list. Make sure both mods are also up to date.

Download
--------

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Sora-yx/SADX-Randomizer/releases).

Installation:
--------

Set up the mod:

1) Download and Install [SADX Mod Loader](https://dcmods.unreliable.network/owncloud/data/PiKeyAr/files/Setup/sadx_setup.exe).
2) Extract and Copy the "Randomizer" folder in the "mods" folder from your SADX folder.
3) You can configure the mod by selecting different settings. Open the SADX mod manager, select "Randomizer" in the Mods list, then Click on "Configure...".
4) If you want to race with a friend, make sure both of you are using the same "seed" in the settings, also make sure the seed used is different than "0". (0 makes the rng always different, when using another number makes it consistent.)


How to use:

Once you are done with the settings, start the game, create a new savefile and select Sonic, then enjoy the show!
A story ends once you beat a specific number of stages, which now include bosses, depending on the character selected.

For more information, please check the "README" in the mod folder.
