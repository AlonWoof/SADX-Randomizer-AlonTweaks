SADX Mod Randomizer
V3.0
___________________________________________________________

Welcome to SADX Randomizer.

Thank you for playing SADX Rando! It's been a while since the last update!

So what's up? 
Well, first of all, the mod has been reworked almost from scratch, with much better implementations of how the files, textures, 
levels and RNG are loaded. Also, the code got a massive cleanup and fixes, which resulted in a reduction in the size of the mod.
Some new features that were intended are finally here such as Randomized cutscenes and new characters/bosses combination.

What about the future of the mod?
Well, Rando has reached a point that I couldn't even dreamed of. Believe it or not, but this took a lot of hardwork to make it how it is at the moment.
Also, I am quite satisfied with the current state of the mod, therefore this is gonna be the last major update for this project. This mod will continue to get minor updates for bug fixes here and here
but that's all. There isn't that much stuff that I would like to add anymore and I have many other projects that I would like to take care of, so I hope you will understand that.
I do appreciate your support regardless and I hope you still have fun with the mod. Like I said, I'm also working on other projects for SADX, 
including SA2 Conversion mod, for more information, you can follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Sora_yxow

FAQ:

Note: Please read all the patch note, before reading the FAQ.

Q: Is Dreamcast Conversion Mod compatible with Randomizer?
A: DC Mod is now fully compatible, as long as the Randomizer mod is loaded AFTER DC mod. Which means rando should be AT THE VERY END of your mod list. This is really important to avoid objects layout issue, so please, double check this.

Q: Is it possible to get a character/stage combination impossible to beat?
A: No, rando has been programmed so you cannot get impossible combination. Any character can beat every action stage, including variation, this has been tested several times.

Q: How does SA2 mission work?
A: Depending on the actual stage, you can randomly get M2 (Collect 100 rings), M3 (Find Lost Chao) or M1. (Beat the stage). Keep in mind that you have more chance to get M1. Also, you can check the current mission if you open the pause menu.

Q: What happens if I miss the Lost Chao, or I don't have enough rings at the end of a stage?
A: A complete Back Ring has been added, similar to what SA2 does, If you hit it, you'll respawn at the beginning.

Q: I can't find the Lost Chao, any tips?
A: https://youtu.be/LGBWX3QrQF8

Q: I don't like those missions, I prefer the original SADX goals.
A: You can disable the missions in the settings of the mod. Open the SADX mod manager, select "Randomizer" in the Mods list, then Click on "Configure..." and set "Allow SA2 Mission" to "false".

Q: Sometimes I hear weird music, like Sonic CD or peaceful music, kinda like Christmas, those aren't in SADX originally right?
A: Those are DLCs music from Sonic Adventure 1. DLCs got scrapped in SADX, but Rando actually restore them.

Q: How am I supposed to catch Froggy when I'm not playing Big the cat?
A: When you get a Big stage, Froggy is hidden somewhere in the stage, the location isn't random, it's always the same, just like Gamma's Emerald Coast.

Q: Why Froggy isn't in the same location as vanilla though?
A: That wouldn't be funny. :^)

Q: Are the Twinkle Circuit tracks randomized?
A: No, the Randomizer uses Twinkle Circuit tracks DLC from Sonic Adventure 1, those are still in the game files, they were just unused originally.

Q: How does AI work?
A: A random AI can sometimes follow you, again, depending on the stage and the character. You can swap between character and AI by pressing Y/Triangle button.

Q: What AI can I get?
A: Sonic, Tails and Amy are the only available AI for now, since the game doesn't really like other combinations.

Q: I noticed that sometimes I have the AI following me, but I can't swap, why?
A: This is because you are in a place where the game can crash if you swap, so the mod disables it for safety. Keep in mind that SADX hasn't been developped to have a different AI than Tails and switching like in Sonic Heroes.

Q: I don't like Sonic Heroes swap, I prefer the original SADX gameplay.
A: You can disable the AI in the settings of the mod. Open the SADX mod manager, select "Randomizer" in the Mods list, then Click on "Configure..." and set "Allow Random AI" to "false".

Q: Is there a way to disable a Character?
A: You can disable any character in the settings of the mod. Open the SADX mod manager, select "Randomizer" in the Mods list, then Click on "Configure..." and set the character you don't want to "True". 

Q: Is there a way to disable a Level/Boss?
A: Not at the moment, however, if you get a specific stage/boss that you don't like, you can open the pause menu, select quit, and then select your character again, this will move to the next stage.

Q: Is there a reason why the Hub World isn't in Sadx Rando?
A: This is mostly for technical reasons; adding the complete story of a character with cutscenes and hub world progression would be difficult and extremely time consuming to do. 
The game has been developped to be completed in a very specific way, there is a lot of stuff which check the current story progression so the game can progress and obviously using any character in any level doesn't help at all, in fact
this breaks the progression a lot.
In other word; this would need a lot of work, including editing a big part of the game code, and even with that, the result might be not good enough. Adding the hub world isn't impossible, but might be a really long term goal.
tl;dr This is lot of work for such a small result.

Installation:

Set up the mod:

1) Download and Install SADX MOD manager: https://dcmods.unreliable.network/owncloud/data/PiKeyAr/files/Setup/sadx_setup.exe
2) Extract and Copy the "Randomizer" folder in the "mods" folder from your SADX folder.
3) You can configure the mod by selecting different settings. Open the SADX mod manager, select "Randomizer" in the Mods list, then Click on "Configure..." It is recommended to keep "have all upgrades" activated, since upgrades help to finish some specific stage or boss.
4) If you want to race with a friend, make sure both of you are using the same "seed" in the settings, also make sure the seed used is different than "0". (0 makes the rng always different, when using another number makes it consistent.)

How to use:

Once you are done with the settings (randomize music, disable characters...) Start the game, create a new savefile, then enjoy the show! 
A story ends once you beat a specific number of stages, which now include bosses, depending on the character selected.  
Enjoy!
